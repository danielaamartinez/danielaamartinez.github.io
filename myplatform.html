      <h2><center>Expanding Educational Opportunities for Women in STEM</center></h2></div>
      <div class="main" style="font-size: x-large;font-family:Cordia New">
      <p> As a woman pursuing a career in computer science, Iâ€™ve noticed a lack of female presence in my science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, women filled 47 percent of all U.S. jobs in 2015, but held only 24 percent of STEM jobs. Also, women make up only 30 percent of all STEM degrees. The only way to change this isolation of women is by promoting STEM to girls from an early age.</p>
      <p>If I were to be crowned Miss Central California, I plan to bring awareness to the community on the importance of promoting diversity in technology. I would educate the community on why learning to code is important and how others can get involved. I hope to lead young women by example that they too can become a programmer, a scientist, a pageant queen or anything that they want to be. By promoting STEM to our younger generations, we will see an increase of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>
